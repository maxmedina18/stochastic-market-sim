# Stochastic Market Simulator & Risk Engine

## Overview
This project implements a stochastic simulation engine for financial markets using Monte Carlo methods. 
It focuses on modeling asset price dynamics, pricing derivatives, and analyzing portfolio risk.

The goal is to build a production-style quantitative research tool with validated mathematical foundations and optimized performance.

## Core Features (Planned)
- Geometric Brownian Motion simulator
- Monte Carlo option pricing
- Portfolio risk analysis (VaR, CVaR)
- Correlation modeling
- Performance optimization
- Visualization tools

## Mathematical Foundations
- Brownian Motion
- Stochastic Differential Equations
- Black-Scholes Model
